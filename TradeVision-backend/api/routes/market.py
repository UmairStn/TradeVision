"""
Live CSE market data endpoints.

    GET /api/v1/market/summary                     gainers, losers, most active, indices
    GET /api/v1/market/quote?symbol=JKH.N0000      one live quote
    GET /api/v1/market/symbols                     every listed company (~285)
    GET /api/v1/market/history?symbol=…&days=90    daily OHLC for the chart
    GET /api/v1/market/intraday?symbol=…           today's tick series

WHY EVERY CSE CALL GOES THROUGH run_in_threadpool
Same rule the prediction route documents: `requests` is synchronous, so calling
it directly from an async handler stalls the event loop and freezes every other
request. services/cse_api.py is deliberately sync — it is the threadpool's job to
keep it off the loop.

WHY /history IS SERVED FROM YAHOO AND NOT THE CSE
The CSE's chart endpoint returns the same 5 daily bars whether you request 7 days
or 365 (verified against period=7/30/90/180/365), so it cannot draw a 1M or 3M
chart. price_data.get_price_history() is used instead, which has the side benefit
that the chart and the model see identical bars — the honest thing to show next to
a prediction. Its stale_days is passed through so the UI can label the gap.
