AI chat endpoint.

    { "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "context": {"symbol": "JKH.N0000"} }

Gemini answers, but it is not allowed to answer from memory: every figure it
states comes from a tool call executed here during the request. This module owns
those tool implementations; services/gemini_chat.py owns the model transport and
the schemas the model sees.

WHY THE HANDLERS LIVE IN THE ROUTE LAYER
They reach api/dependencies.py for the shared XGBoost engine and FinBERT
analyzer, and api/routes/prediction.py for the analysis orchestration. Putting
them in services/ would make services/ import api/ — backwards. So the service
declares the tools and the route supplies the functions.

Everything here is blocking (requests, yfinance, FinBERT, the Gemini SDK), so the
entire chat turn goes through run_in_threadpool for the reasons documented at the
top of routes/prediction.py.
