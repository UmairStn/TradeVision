"""
Feature engineering — the single source of truth shared by training and serving.

`ml/train_model.py` and `services/prediction_engine.py` both import FEATURE_COLUMNS
and the builders here. That is the whole point of this module: if training and
inference computed features independently they would drift, and a drifted feature
produces a confident, plausible, wrong prediction with nothing in the stack to
flag it.

THE MODEL CONTRACT (do not reorder — XGBoost matches on position):

    Open_Pct, High_Pct, Low_Pct, Rel_Volume,
    RSI_14, RSI_7, Return_Lag1, Return_Lag2, Return_Lag3

CROSS-SECTIONAL BY DESIGN. Every feature above is scale-free, so the model
learns "what does this pattern imply about tomorrow" rather than "what does
company #3 usually do". That is what lets it predict ANY CSE ticker, including
ones absent from training.

Two features were deliberately removed to get here:

  * Asset_ID — an integer company index. Its tree splits only covered the 9
    training companies, so a 10th had no valid value to pass. This was the sole
    reason the old model was locked to 9 stocks.
  * Log_Volume — log1p(raw share count), roughly 15 for a large cap and 9 for a
    thin counter. Less obvious than Asset_ID but the same leak: it encoded
    company size. Replaced by Rel_Volume, which compares a stock's volume to its
    OWN recent average and therefore means the same thing everywhere.

One quirk is replicated deliberately from the original training script:

  * Return_Lag1 is `pct_change().shift(1)` — the return over t-2 -> t-1, NOT
    yesterday's return. The current day's own return is computed but never used
    as a feature. Almost certainly unintended upstream; kept so this retrain
    changes one thing at a time. Revisit separately.

RSI is still divided by 100, matching the original training script, which read
pre-computed 0-100 RSI columns out of the CSVs and rescaled them.

    Keep only bars that actually traded. Shared by training and serving.

    A zero-volume row is not "a quiet day" — no shares changed hands, so its
    Close is the previous close carried forward. Yahoo's CSE feed makes this
    impossible to ignore: it keeps emitting daily rows long after it loses the
    exchange. Measured on JKH-N0000.CM, ~85% of days traded across 5 years but
    only 7 of the most recent 129 did, with the last 8 closes byte-identical.

    Left in, those rows do damage at both ends of the pipeline:
      * Training  — they manufacture zero-return observations and zero-return
        labels, teaching the model that "nothing happens" is the common case.
      * Inference — they are the LAST rows, so they are the ones the prediction
        is built from. Every return goes to 0, RSI pins at 50, and the 20-day
        volume mean tends to 0, so Rel_Volume either goes NaN (a loud failure,
        which is the good case) or clips to REL_VOLUME_CAP on the one day
        something traded (a confident prediction from an artefact, which is not).

    Dropping them is not cleaning-to-taste: it is removing rows that record the
    absence of data. This MUST stay identical on both paths — a model trained on
    traded-only bars and served forward-filled ones is exactly the train/serve
    skew this module exists to prevent.
